 * Contains classes to create the JavaFX-based version of the photo viewer's
 * view component. Class <code>AgilePhotoViewerApp</code> starts the
 * application. The architecture is inspired by the model - view - presenter pattern.
 * File <code>AgilePhotoViewer.fxml</code> defines the layout of
 * the view component. <code>AgilePhotoViewer.css</code> provides a dark theme
 * for the GUI. Class <code>AgilePhotoViewerController</code> is the entry point
 * for event handling. It mediates between view and model.
