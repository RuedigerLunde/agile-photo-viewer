<h1>Agile Photo Viewer</h1>
<h2>Version 1.1 (30-Mar-2015)</h2>

<p>This lightweight pure-java photo viewer provides the following features:
<ul>
<li>Show picture locations in map image (haven't seen this feature elsewhere...)</li>
<li>Display Exif-Tags, especially caption, date, camera model, position, and keywords
(using the library of Drew Noakes, see http://drewnoakes.com/code/exif/)</li>
<li>Control picture visibility by keyword (with flexible positive and negative 
selection criteria)</li>
<li>Select picture by map position</li>
<li>Sort pictures by name and date</li>
<li>Export visible pictures with new indexed names preserving chosen order
(useful when using different cameras)</li>
<li>Support full-screen mode (some functions disabled)</li>
<li>Support presenter mouse</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p><b>To install</b>, just copy the executable jar on your hard disk drive.
Make sure that your Java is up to date. Additionally, there is a starter (cmd-file)
available which starts the viewer with additional heap space from a shell
showing error messages if any.</p>

<p><b>To start</b>, double-click the jar or cmd file, press 'Select' and select a
picture file or a directory with pictures in the file chooser. You can zoom
into the picture by mouse-wheel and mouse-drag. Check sharpness with mouse-middle.
The viewer is directory-based. You can move back and forth with the
control panel buttons.  If you don't want to see all pictures
in the current directory, specify a visibility expression in the Keyword Panel.
Select what you want to see and what you don't using the 'Negate'-Button.
The Info Panel shows you some metadata about the
current picture. Picture captions can also be displayed in the status area using
the context menu of the Control Panel (recommended). Text size can be adjusted
via the same context menu. If an exreme high resolution display is used, exit
and restart the application to reuse text size settings also for menus and buttons.
Picasa is a suitable tool to add captions
and keywords ('poster', 'private', 'people', 'historic', ...) to your pictures.
When pressing 'Exit', your personal settings are saved in your home directory
('.agilephotoviewer').</p>

<p><b>To export pictures</b> via the context menu of the control panel,
you can either just specify the destination directory or provide also
a file name like '2012-Scotland-0005'. The first copied picture will
then be named '2012-Scotland-0006.jpg' if it is a jpg file.</p>

<p><b>To use the Map Panel</b>, try the following:
<ul>
<li>Navigate to a picture showing a map (e.g. a photo of a map or a screenshot of
Google Earth possibly including track data) and press 'Use Photo as Map' in the
context menu of the Control Panel.</li>
<li>Navigate to a (correctly!) geotagged picture and mark its position on the
map with 'Set Reference Point Here' (context menu of the Map Panel). Repeat with
another picture. Now a red marker should follow the locations of the pictures shown
in the photo panel. Accuracy improves when at least three reference points
(placed in a triangle) are set. Reference points can be removed by
'Remove Reference Point Here' (mouse-right on the reference point's position).
Additionally, the context menu provides and option to show all visible picture
positions in the map (recommended).
By mouse-left on the map you load the picture next to the current
mouse position into the Photo Panel.</li>
<li>Previously prepared map images can be opened using the context menu of the
Map Panel.</li>
</ul>
</p>
