Nowadays it is quite usual, that you return from holidays with hundreds or even thousands of photos and other related data, e.g. track data from external loggers. Applications like Picasa, Google Earth, GPicSync, and GeoSetter help to organise the data, add keywords to photos, visualise track data on a map, and geotag DSLR camera photos. But finding an easy-to-use application which presents the artifacts in a flexible, non-linear fashion still seems to be difficult.

AgilePhotoViewer is a lightweight pure-java photo viewer which presents geotagged photos together with a map image. No Internet access is needed for that. Just select a screenshot of Google Earth as map image and locate at least two photos in it. The layout is especially useful for presentation on 16:9 displays. Photos can be filtered by keyword, selected by map position, ordered by name and Exif-date, and exported using new indexed names.
