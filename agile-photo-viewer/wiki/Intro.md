Nowadays it is quite usual, that you return from holidays with hundreds or
even thousands of photos and other related data, e.g. track data from external
loggers. Applications like Picasa, Google Earth, GPicSync, and GeoSetter help
to organise the data, add keywords to photos, visualise track data on a map,
and geotag DSLR camera photos. But how can those artifacts be presented in a
flexible, non-linear fashion?

AgilePhotoViewer is a lightweight pure-java photo viewer which allows to
present geotagged photos together with a map image. No Internet access is
needed for that. It is especially useful for presentation on 16:9 displays.
Photos can be selected by keyword and map position, ordered by name and
Exif-date, and exported using new indexed names.
