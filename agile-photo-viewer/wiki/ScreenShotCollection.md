Visibility of photos can be controlled using the Visibility Panel. The rating filter (first combo-box) reduces visibility to those photos having at least the specified number of stars. The controls below can be used to specify a logical expression. Keyword Expression 'poster or highlight' reduces visibility to
those photos, which have at least keyword 'poster' or 'highlight'. 'true' means that all photos in the current directory are visible.
